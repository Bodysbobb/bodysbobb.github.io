I am a **Ph.D. candidate in Agricultural Economics at Purdue University** and a **research assistant at GTAP**, specializing in **international trade policies, CGE modeling, and data-driven economic analysis**. With a strong foundation in **trade policy, economic modeling, and data science**, I bridge research with real-world applications.

Beyond academia, I am an **entrepreneur and business strategist**. As the **Co-founder, CFO, and Head of Data Analytics at <a href="https://bodysbobb.github.io/projects/AMATAProduction/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">AMATA Production Co., Ltd.</a>**, I have built and scaled a business from the ground up, integrating economic and business expertise with data-driven decision-making. Previously, I worked as a **Business Data Analyst at Unilever Thailand**, specializing in **market analytics and forecasting** to optimize business strategies.

With **over six years of combined experience in research, business, and corporate analytics**, I bring a unique ability to **analyze complex datasets, develop strategic solutions, and drive impactful results**. My technical expertise includes **developing R packages, Python applications, and building business databases via JavaScript (Google Apps)**. I have contributed to **official R packages on CRAN** and built analytical tools to support trade policy and business decision-making. Explore my programming projects at **<a href="https://bodysbobb.github.io/projects/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">my portfolio</a>**.

A recipient of the **prestigious Anandamahidol Foundation scholarship**, awarded by the Thai Royal Family for Master to Ph.D. studies in the U.S., I am committed to applying **economic insights, data analytics, and strategic problem-solving** to research and business solutions.

I am actively seeking opportunities in **data analytics, economic consulting, and trade policy research**, where I can leverage my **diverse expertise** to solve complex problems and drive data-driven decision-making.
